Release Notes
2/21/2016

Apollo is my working name for a wrapper around SQLite3.  I have tested it a little and it compiles and runs.

Features:
1. This is a replacement for sqlite4java, available at almworks.com.  This doesn't do everything that sqlite4java
does, however.
2. This has a very simple interface.  Look at DataStore.
3. This requires transactions to be explicit.  
4. This only works on Windows due to using mutexes and process ids.
5. You don't have to use sql to create tables, or do inserts or selects.  However, you still have the option
 of coding custom sql code.

Sample code for an insert:
	Person p=new Person();
	p.first_name="Bob";
	p.last_name="Jones";

	//insert it in database
	Transaction t=DataStore.createTransaction();
	t.begin();
	long key=t.insert(p);
	t.commit();

To retrieve the same object:
	Person p2=(Person)DataStore.get("Person",key);
	System.out.println(p2.first_name);

Missing features and Wish List for later versions:
1. Pickle (serializable) format for objects
2. Automatic backup of updated and deleted object in a history table.
3. Custom types, including date, time and enumerations.
4. PreparedStatements
5. Allow id fields with name other than "id".  Right now the primary key is hard-coded in several places
to this value.
6. Blobs and storage of byte arrays.
